## Quick drawing settings adjuster
Two new tools are added to the Drawing sidebar. These tools open a popup menu that allows fast adjustment of stroke or fill color, opacity, line width, and fill type. The changes to drawing settings are continuously updated as you make adjustments on the panel, and it can be closed by clicking anywhere off of it.

The first tool controls line settings. The menu for lines contains options for changing stroke color, opacity, and line width.

The second tool controls fill settings. The menu for fill contains options for changing fill color, opacity, and fill type.

## TODO
- [ ] Add ability to open the menu by some modified click, such as ctrl-click. Need to find a modifier key that isn't used by drawing tools already.
- [ ] Modify button style so that rather than a brush or paint can icon, the buttons have a box showing the current stroke or fill color.
- [ ] Add the ability to choose color by using a dropper tool and selecting the color from the canvas.
